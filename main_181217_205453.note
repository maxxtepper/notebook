This is the main notebook. I do not know what that actually means.

Basically, what this app does is allow a user to create notebooks and add notes to them, while being named via a time-stamp, along with the name of the notebook

Eventually, I want to be able to process the words I use in these notes by counting them, to see what words I use most, and in which context with respect to other words.
